                            A large number of auto loan customers reaching the end of their loan term discovered a
                            remaining balance on their account ($200 on average) due to deviations in their repayment
                            history resulting in additional accrued interest over the life of their loan. This led to
                            increased call volume and an overall frustrating experience for customers trying to
                            understand what caused the balance to remain after they made, what they thought, was their
                            last payment. My team was tasked with developing a set of features focused on educating and
                            helping customers prevent events that would lead to the ending balance.

                            tool, users could find out things like whether or not they were ahead or behind on their
                            repayment plan. If they were behind, how much would be due at the end of their loan?
                            Inversely, if they were paying extra or early, how much they would save and if possible, how
                            much earlier they would pay off the loan?

                            their situation while avoiding embarrassing phone calls with customer service

                                    the phone through call-center agents but with added flexibility to account for

                                    increments. Customers had additional configurable options including changing initial
                                    payment dates, adjusting payment amounts, and choosing due dates for subsequent
                                    payments. Starting from a place of empathy in how the options were communicated
                                    resonated in early concept testing and was validated in subsequent call listening
                                    sessions after the tool launched.

                                    customers who commit to a custom payment plan are much more likely to get current on
