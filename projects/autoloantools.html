                                    In 2017, over half of Capital One auto loan customers reaching the end of their loan
                                    term discovered a remaining balance on their account ($200 on average). This was
                                    typically due to deviations in their repayment history resulting in additional
                                    accrued interest over the life of their loan. As you can imagine, this led to
                                    frustrated customers calling in trying to understand what caused a balance to remain
                                    after they made, what they thought, was their final payment. My team and I were
                                    tasked with developing a set of features focused on educating and helping customers
                                    prevent events that would lead to a balance at the end of their loan.

                                    We designed and developed a loan tracking feature that gives customers information
                                    to answer the question of “How am I doing?” when it comes to their repayment plan.
                                    With this tool, customers can easily find out if they are ahead, behind, or on
                                    schedule with their payment plan. If they are behind, the tool shows them how much
                                    is projected to be due at the end of their loan. Inversely, if they are paying extra
                                    or early, how much they will save and possibly, how much earlier they would pay off
                                    the loan.

                                            This tool allowed customers to create a personalized payment plan and spread
                                            out their past due amount over a few months, getting current through
                                            manageable increments. Customers have additional configurable options
                                            including changing payment dates and adjusting payment amounts.
