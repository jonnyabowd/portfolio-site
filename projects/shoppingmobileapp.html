                            Capital One acquired Wikibuy in fall 2018 and I was brought on to lead the design team while
                            working to integrate and improve the company’s product offering. The
                            existing Wikibuy mobile application had issues with usability, stability,
                            new

                            team and I were tasked with shoring up the customer experience, improving

                            engagement, and increasing downstream effects to potential revenue.
